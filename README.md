# Cars.csv Python Data Analysis

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of cars using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The dataset (`cars.csv`) contains information about various car models, and the analysis includes data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization of different aspects of the data.

## Project Overview

This repository is part of the Summer Analytics Data Science 2025 course. The main objectives are to:
- Load and explore the `cars.csv` dataset
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Analyze various features and relationships within the data
- Visualize insights using charts and graphs

## Dataset

- **File:** `cars.csv`
- **Description:** Contains details about different car models, including attributes such as make, model, year, price, mileage, and more.

> **Note:** Ensure the `cars.csv` file is present in the working directory before running the analysis notebook.

## Features Analyzed

Some of the aspects explored in the analysis include:
- Distribution of car prices
- Most common car brands and models
- Car age and mileage relationships
- Correlation between features (e.g., price vs. mileage)
- Outlier detection and handling of missing data

## Technologies Used

- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Python 3**
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TazeemTayob17/cars.csv-python-analysis.git
   cd cars.csv-python-analysis
2. Make sure you have the required Python libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib.pyplot seaborn
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
4. Then open the analysis notebook file (e.g., cars_analysis.ipynb). Run each cell in sequence to perform the analysis.

## Key Findings

- The most popular car brands and models in the dataset were identified.
- Car prices were found to be influenced by factors such as mileage, age, and brand.
- Relationships such as price vs. mileage and price vs. age were visualized and analyzed.
- Outliers and missing data were detected and handled to improve analysis accuracy.
- The analysis provided insights into trends and patterns across different car features.

## Visualizations

- **Histograms**: Plotted to show the distribution of car prices and mileages.
- **Bar Charts**: Displayed the frequency of different car brands and models.
- **Scatterplots**: Illustrated relationships between price, mileage, and age of the cars.
- **Correlation Heatmaps**: Highlighted correlations between multiple numerical features.
